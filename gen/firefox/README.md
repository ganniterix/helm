## firefox

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.

The the docker image is part of the the [`linuxserver.io`](https://www.linuxserver.io/) collection, it has a great [documentation](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-firefox) that cover all the image features.

## About

This chart was created with [Node.JS script](https://noygal.github.io/helm//scripts/nodejs), and relay on [`base-chart`](https://noygal.github.io/helm//base-chart) dependency for templates functionally - allowing the use of highly flexible single `value.yaml` file for describing the chart. Please refer to `base-chart` documentation for a full API description. The script scrape the [docker-documentation](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-documentation) repository, that contains the documentation for all the `linuxserver.io` images.

The the default values for the script are set to my local network configuration - [`k3s`](https://k3s.io/) cluster on raspberry pi 4 and NFS server on `192.168.1.10`, you can use the script [configuration](https://noygal.github.io/helm//scripts/nodejs/config.js) to generate charts that fit your configuration.

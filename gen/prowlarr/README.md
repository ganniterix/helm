# Helm chart (V3) - prowlarr

## prowlarr

[Prowlarr](https://github.com/Prowlarr/Prowlarr) is a indexer manager/proxy built on the popular arr .net/reactjs base stack to integrate with your various PVR apps. Prowlarr supports both Torrent Trackers and Usenet Indexers. It integrates seamlessly with Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, and Readarr offering complete management of your indexers with no per app Indexer setup required (we do it all).

The the docker image is part of the the [`linuxserver.io`](https://www.linuxserver.io/) collection, it has a great [documentation](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-prowlarr) that cover all the image features.

## About

This chart was created with [Node.JS script](https://ekavallieri.github.io/public-helm-charts//scripts/nodejs), and relay on [`base-chart`](https://ekavallieri.github.io/public-helm-charts//base-chart) dependency for templates functionally - allowing the use of highly flexible single `value.yaml` file for describing the chart. Please refer to `base-chart` documentation for a full API description. The script scrape the [docker-documentation](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-documentation) repository, that contains the documentation for all the `linuxserver.io` images.

The the default values for the script are set to my local network configuration - [`k3s`](https://k3s.io/) cluster on raspberry pi 4 and NFS server on `192.168.1.10`, you can use the script [configuration](https://ekavallieri.github.io/public-helm-charts//scripts/nodejs/config.js) to generate charts that fit your configuration.

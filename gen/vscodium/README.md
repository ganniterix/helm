## About

This chart was created with [Node.JS script](https://noygal.github.io/helm//scripts/nodejs), and relay on [`base-chart`](https://noygal.github.io/helm//base-chart) dependency for templates functionally - allowing the use of highly flexible single `value.yaml` file for describing the chart. Please refer to `base-chart` documentation for a full API description. The script scrape the [docker-documentation](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-documentation) repository, that contains the documentation for all the `linuxserver.io` images.

The the default values for the script are set to my local network configuration - [`k3s`](https://k3s.io/) cluster on raspberry pi 4 and NFS server on `192.168.1.10`, you can use the script [configuration](https://noygal.github.io/helm//scripts/nodejs/config.js) to generate charts that fit your configuration.
